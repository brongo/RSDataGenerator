# RSDataGenerator v1.0 by SamPT

This tool generates the "rs_data" file used by EternalModInjector. Should build easily in Windows. Needs some adjustments before it will work on Linux systems - can probably update this in a few days.

USAGE: RSDataGenerator.exe <path>
Where <path> is the path to your DOOM Eternal installation directory.

**Note: this is untested and probably won't work on Gamepass versions.**
