# RSDataGenerator v1.0 by SamPT

This tool generates the "rs_data" file used by EternalModInjector. Should build easily in Windows. Needs some adjustments before it will work on Linux systems - can probably update this in a few days.

Usage: `RSDataGenerator.exe <path>` 
(full path to your DOOM Eternal installation directory).

**Important:** Make sure your game is verified/repaired and not modified in any way prior to using this. There is no need to extract files. .mapresource files will be automatically extracted to `<path>/MapResources` when the program is run.

**Note: this is untested and probably doesn't work on Gamepass versions.**
